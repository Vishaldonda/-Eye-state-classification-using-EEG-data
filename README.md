# Eye-state-classification-using-EEG-data
The projects consists of finding whether eye state can be predicted using EEG signals. Along with the data analysis a better performing classification algorithm is proposed.
Basically we will be performing various data cleaning methods (z-test, IQR, and removing outliers) and after performing Principal Component Analysis, various classification algorithms are performed and we result in the best possibly efficiency method.
